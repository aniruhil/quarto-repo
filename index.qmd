## 

Given the speed with which [Quarto](https://quarto.org/) is developing, it is very likely that I'll end up switching my site off [{distill}](https://rstudio.github.io/distill/website.html). In large part this would be because of the ability to author interactive documents using `Shiny` and `Observable JS`. As always, my thanks to the @hrbrmstr for writing something about [Observable](https://observablehq.com/) that caught my eye, which led to a lot of time spent watching [Mike Bostock weave his magic](https://observablehq.com/@mbostock) and trying to learn something from it. I hope this repository grows lickety split!
